How to run the implementation.
Make sure to run the script in the same path you find it. It is important so that the code can work properly.

Disclamer: 
  a) there is no separated "model file". By running the implementation of the 2 models you will see the results.
  b) All the other files can be seen at the github repository, please refer to it at: 
      Github repository "https://github.com/abu-sbeit/adv-pm"

0) Open the directory: "python"

1) To see all the steps done, comprehensive of the first data filtering on python (the data used was pre-processed in Disco)
    Open the jupyter notebook: "A_data_loading.ipynb" 

2) To run the implementation of the 2 models
    Open the jupyter notebook: "A_data_anlysis.ipynb" 
    Run the sections:   -Resume here
                        -Feature engineering ...
                        -Random Forest Implementation
                        -GBC Implementation
                          → the tuning of the parameter takes a long time, but we left it 
                            for transparence. You can avoid to run that chunk.

3) To see the visualizations used in the report, run also the section "Visualizations"
